# Swagger to Notebook to Microservice

This sample project demonstrates how to use a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) specification to generate a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook.
The generated notebook is then by the [Jupyter Kernel Gateway](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/kernel_gateway) and is turned into a REST microservice.
